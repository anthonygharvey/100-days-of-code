# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Anthony Harvey

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 20, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
I learned about restricting routes to users that are logged in.  I also learned about hashed and salted passwords, which are VERY interesting and important.  Rails has a class method called has_secure_password method that does all of the heavy lifting of hashing a password and prepending a salt (to counter rainbow tables) through the BCrypt gem.  I used BCrypt in my [Developer Journal](https://github.com/anthonygharvey/developer_journal) app, but it's learn more detial about how it encrypts passwords! 

### R1D2&3
I worked on authentication in Rails yesterday and today.  The more I learn about Rails the more I love it!

### R1D4

I worked on a simple Rails app and implemented OmniAuth to login with a Facebook email and password.  This was my first time using OmniAuth and it seems cool.  I like the idea of making it as easy as possible for users to signup for my apps with a ubiquitous service like Facebook.  I plan to learn more about other providers (strategies in Rails) like Google, Twitter and Amazon for my upcoming Ruby on Rails project!

I also signed up for two Meetups for next week!  These will be my first meetups and I'm excited to get plugged into the Charlotte developer scene.  The first Meetup is [Turning Pro: Advice on Making the Switch to Professional Developer](http://meetu.ps/e/FfF23/Dt3Gn/f) on May 30 and the second is [Web Performance Techniques](http://meetu.ps/e/FdMRb/Dt3Gn/f) on May 31.

### R1D5
Added OmniAuth with GitHub to a TodoMVC Rails app.  I'm learning more about the security provided by using OAuth, which is amazing considering how fast the authentication happens!

### R1D6
Worked on a small Rails project combining form helpers, models that interact and a simple sessions system.  I finished building the models and passed the tests.  I'll work on the forms and sessions tomorrow!

#### R1D7
More progress today on the Rails project.  It's starting to come together but there are a lot of pieces.  Tomorrow I'll work on building out the views.

### R1D8
I finished my small Rails app and started planning my Rails portfolio project.  I definitely see the value in taking time to plan a project before writing the first line of code!

### R1D9
I updated the plan for my Rails portfolio project today and started mapping out the models and relationships.  I also received some great news today, I won a diversity scholarship to [MongoDB World 2018](https://www.mongodb.com/world18)!  I'm beyond excited and can't wait to attend!  Today was also the start of the MongoDB for Node.js Developers course on MongoDB University, so I started that as well.

### R1D10
I made some updates to my models and relationship maps for my Rails project.  I'm glad I took the time to plan it out because it made coding the models and relationships much easier!  I also went to my first Meetup!  The title of the meet up was [`Turning Pro: Advice on Making the Switch to Professional Developer](https://www.meetup.com/charlottedevs/events/250514891).  The speakers were great and I met a lot of awesome developers in the community.  I definitely will be going to more!
