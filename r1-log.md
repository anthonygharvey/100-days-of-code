## Log

### R1D1 
I learned about restricting routes to users that are logged in.  I also learned about hashed and salted passwords, which are VERY interesting and important.  Rails has a class method called has_secure_password method that does all of the heavy lifting of hashing a password and prepending a salt (to counter rainbow tables) through the BCrypt gem.  I used BCrypt in my [Developer Journal](https://github.com/anthonygharvey/developer_journal) app, but it's learn more detial about how it encrypts passwords!
