# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Anthony Harvey

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 20, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
I learned about restricting routes to users that are logged in.  I also learned about hashed and salted passwords, which are VERY interesting and important.  Rails has a class method called has_secure_password method that does all of the heavy lifting of hashing a password and prepending a salt (to counter rainbow tables) through the BCrypt gem.  I used BCrypt in my [Developer Journal](https://github.com/anthonygharvey/developer_journal) app, but it's learn more detial about how it encrypts passwords! 

### R1D2&3
I worked on authentication in Rails yesterday and today.  The more I learn about Rails the more I love it!

### R1D4

I worked on a simple Rails app and implemented OmniAuth to login with a Facebook email and password.  This was my first time using OmniAuth and it seems cool.  I like the idea of making it as easy as possible for users to signup for my apps with a ubiquitous service like Facebook.  I plan to learn more about other providers (strategies in Rails) like Google, Twitter and Amazon for my upcoming Ruby on Rails project!

I also signed up for two Meetups for next week!  These will be my first meetups and I'm excited to get plugged into the Charlotte developer scene.  The first Meetup is [Turning Pro: Advice on Making the Switch to Professional Developer](http://meetu.ps/e/FfF23/Dt3Gn/f) on May 30 and the second is [Web Performance Techniques](http://meetu.ps/e/FdMRb/Dt3Gn/f) on May 31.
